abstract: At the first stage of the project, a model of vibrations of one-dimensional chains of particles is investigated within the framework of mathematical modeling. A harmonic chain (a linear model with independent modes, standing waves, and dispersion relations) and an anharmonic chain (a nonlinear model of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulama problem) are theoretically described. In the latter, a nonlinear term is introduced, leading to the absence of thermalization of energy and quasi-periodic behavior of the system. The main scientific problem is to identify the conditions for the transition to thermal equilibrium, including the influence of the number of particles, the magnitude of the nonlinearity and the initial conditions. The Fourier transform is used for the analysis, which makes it possible to study the spectral distribution of energy. The results of the stage emphasize the fundamental difference between linear and nonlinear systems, and also raise questions for further study of the dynamics of complex oscillatory systems.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Linear (harmonic) and nonlinear (anharmonic) models of chain oscillations are investigated. The harmonic system retains independent modes, in the anharmonic (FPU) energy is not thermalized, quasi-periodicity is revealed. The main problem is the conditions of transition to thermal equilibrium.
