   In this final stage of the work, the main attention is paid to discussing the obtained results of modeling a three-massive oscillatory circuit and interpreting their physical meaning. Based on the analysis of natural frequencies, forms of normal modes, and spectral densities of vibrations, key patterns of energy distribution between masses and manifestations of quasi–periodic behavior in anharmonic systems (the Fermi-Pasta–Ulama problem) have been identified.

   The main conclusions of the study:

   The natural frequencies of the harmonic chain fully correspond to theoretical predictions, confirming the correctness of the mathematical model and the algorithm for calculating normal modes.

   The spectral analysis shows clear peaks at natural frequencies, which indicates the dominant contribution of the corresponding normal fluctuations.

   With the introduction of anharmonic interactions, a gradual redistribution of energy between modes is observed, leading to quasi-periodic dynamics and slow sintering (recurrence) of energy into the initial modes.

   The analysis of phase trajectories highlights the differences between harmonic and anharmonic modes: in the latter case, the trajectories become more complex and exhibit poor sensitivity to the initial disturbance.

   Conclusion: the discussion of the results shows that the proposed numerical approach in the Julia language allows not only reproducing classical normal modes, but also effectively investigating the dynamics of anharmonic systems, opening up new possibilities for studying nonlinear effects in oscillatory circuits.

Summary: |
   In the final section, the emphasis is shifted to an in-depth analysis of the modeling conclusions of a three-massive oscillatory circuit. The accuracy of calculating normal modes is confirmed through the coincidence of natural frequencies with theory, the dominance of individual modes in the oscillation spectrum is revealed, and the energy redistribution during anharmonic interactions is studied. Quasi-periodic behavior and energy recurrences in the initial modes were detected, and phase trajectories showed a complication of dynamics in the nonlinear regime. The ratings demonstrate that the presented method on Julia is effective both for analysts of linear commercial groups and for researchers of neutral names.

## 1. Introduction  
In this paper, the dynamics of a three-massive oscillatory circuit with harmonic and weakly anharmonic interactions is analyzed. The main purpose is to discuss what physical conclusions numerical experiments provide and to what extent they are consistent with the theory of normal modes and the behavior of Fermi–Pasta–Ulam return systems.

---

## 2. Setting the task  
System: three groups(m=[1,2,1]), combined groups(k=[1,1,1,1]), initial groups dealing with mixtures and velocities.  
The task is to obtain a time series of displacements and velocities, construct a spectrum and phase trajectories, and then interpret the physical meaning of the observations.

---

## 3. Methodology  

- Solving equations of motion in normal coordinates;  
- Fast Fourier transform for spectral analysis;  
- Acquaintance with the variable genus and its editors in Julia.

## 4. Analysis of the results  

- **Natural frequencies and normal modes**  
  The calculated frequencies clearly coincided with the theory of the linear circuit, which confirms the correctness of the model.  

- **Spectral peaks**  
  Pronounced peaks at natural frequencies are observed in the FFT spectra, which indicates the dominant contribution of individual modes to the overall dynamics.

- **Energy distribution**  
  In the harmonic mode, energy is conserved in initially excited modes, whereas in anharmonic interactions, there is a gradual redistribution of energy between modes and manifestations of quasi-periodicity.

- **Phase trajectories**  
  The graphs of phase trajectories show well–ordered ellipses in the linear case and complicated, "blurring" trajectories under FPU perturbations, which reflects poor sensitivity to initial conditions.

## 5. Conclusion  
The discussion showed that the numerical approach in Julia's language is necessary to create classical normative models and purposefully introduces new technologies to the market.– the system. This opens up opportunities for further study of the dynamics of more complex link chains and nonlinear oscillatory systems.
