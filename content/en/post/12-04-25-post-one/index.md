Introduction:

 The topic of chain oscillations is a fundamental problem of a physicist
dynamics of a rigid body and nonlinear dynamics. All bodies are made up of atoms, each
of which has three degrees of freedom. In crystal structures
, most of these degrees of freedom are associated with oscillatory movements.
 According to thermodynamics, in a state of thermal equilibrium for each wheel
the energy 𝑘𝑇 accounts for the final degree of freedom, which leads to the molar heat capacity of the crystal 𝑐𝑉 = 3𝑅 (the law of Dulong and Petit).ti). However, in order to understand the processes of achieving equilibrium and the characteristics of vibrations, it is necessary to
study model systems, such as one-dimensional chains of particles. This
project examines both harmonic and anharmonic chains,
including the famous Fermi-Pasta-Ulama (FPU) problem, as well as analysis methods.
 using the Fourier transform.
