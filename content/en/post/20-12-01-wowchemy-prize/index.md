The Young Hospitality Summit (YHS) is a summit for young professionals in the hospitality industry, where participants not only gain knowledge from world leaders in the hospitality industry, but also work on current challenges in the field of tourism. The event was held at the leading hotel business school EHL Hospitality Business & Hotel Management School. She is ranked 1st in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2025 in the category of Hospitality & Leisure Management.

RUDN University students Dmitry Chinaliev and Natalia Zlatovchena went to test their professional knowledge and skills at the Young Hospitality Summit — 2025.

All students were divided into 12 international teams of 6 people each. The division was carried out in such a way that students from the same university could not be in the same team. Each group developed strategic solutions for key challenges of the tourism industry:

Excessive tourism on the Greek Islands, Venice and Barcelona;
Promoting Bordeaux wine tourism in France for Generation Z with a creative approach.
The participants received their assignments 10 days before the start of the summit. I spent that time gathering information and getting to know my teammates. The students also had 3 days to solve the main task.

For example, Dmitry Chinaliev's team was developing a strategy for managing the tourist flow in Venice. The goal was to distribute tourists to different locations and reduce the load on the main attractions of the city.

The students proposed to develop an application for three main actors: government, local business and tourists. According to the authors, the main "features" of the application will be:

automation of tourist tax collection;
real-time display of crowds on a city map (heat map);
building an ideal route for a tourist based on AI in order to avoid excessive congestion of tourists in one place;
data collection mechanism;
recommendations for visiting AI-based locations.
The project brought Dmitry's team the 2nd place.

Natalia Zlatovcena also returned from Switzerland with a victory. Together with her team, she developed a project to develop wine tourism in Bordeaux, which was recognized by the jury as the best.

The students needed to come up with a strategy to promote the Bordeaux region, given the falling demand for wine consumption among young people. The team was developing an idea for one of the three chateaux from Vignobles Cruse-Lorenzetti. The authors suggested adding QR codes to the bottles, which will tell the facts about a particular wine, the history of its origin and information about what it is best combined with.

During the preparation for the summit, the students were assisted by supervisors: Olga Zeveke, Ph.D. in Economics, Associate Professor of the Department of Tourism and Service at the Higher School of Economics, and Kamo Chilingaryan, Ph.D., Head of the Department of Foreign Languages at the Higher School of Economics.

Congratulations to our students and wish them more professional victories!
