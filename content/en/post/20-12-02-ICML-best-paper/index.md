The main objective of the Technologies for Human Health competition is to provide comprehensive support to research teams creating innovative biotechnologies to promote human health.

143 research teams from more than 50 regions of Russia took part in the competition with their research. The examination was conducted by the Russian Academy of Sciences and leading organizations of practical healthcare. Only 17 of the best works reached the final.

According to the results of the expert evaluation by the jury, the work "Personalized drug therapy in patients of extreme age groups with polymorbidity" by the staff of the RUDN University Department under the leadership of Sergey Zyryanov took 1st place in the nomination "Transition to personalized predictive and preventive medicine".

The topic of the work: "Personalized drug therapy in patients of extreme age groups with polymorbidity"
Elderly and senile patients, as well as premature newborns, are at risk of developing infectious diseases, therefore, approaches to therapy require an integrated and individualized approach. It is necessary not only to take into account the possibility of two or more diseases in a patient, but also to choose drugs and their optimal dosages with an emphasis on the peculiarities of metabolism in these groups of patients.

The authors have shown the practical importance of a comprehensive method for optimizing antibiotic treatment, as well as for developing local recommendations for the treatment of infections that occur in hospitals.

The results of the study were used in the creation of the federal guidelines "Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of infections caused by polyresistant strains of microorganisms" (updated in 2022). The developed algorithms for personalizing antibacterial therapy in critically ill patients can be used as the basis for medical decision support systems. The development and subsequent implementation of such systems in the clinical practice of intensive care units will help to increase the efficiency of doctors. This will reduce the burden associated with the need to perform complex calculations to determine the dose of antibiotics.
